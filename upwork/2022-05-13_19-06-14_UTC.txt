Meet Peter Reuben, Top Rated Virtual Assistant found on Upwork. “I help business executives and CEOs to be more organized so they can focus on the strategic and critical parts of the business needed for growth.” #UpworkSpotlight 

“I started freelancing after I heard a senior friend talk about the Upwork platform. I signed up and have been freelancing for 14 months. I had previously worked in a top consulting firm, but I love the flexibility and variety that freelancing offers me.” 

How does Peter make certain his clients have a great experience? “I try to ensure we are both on the same page at all times by ensuring communications and feedbacks are as clear as possible.”

“With the Great Resignation, skilled people are choosing to freelance because of the flexibility. You either jump on the bus now or be somewhat late. Working with freelancers means you can access top global talents from any part of the world. How cool can that be? And this large pool means there is a high percentage to find someone that ticks ALL boxes.” 

His message to freelancers? “My favourite thing is the flexibility that comes with freelancing on Upwork. Also, I am less worried about payments as Upwork already has a system that makes the exchange really efficient. I only focus on delivering my deliverables.” 

“Starting out on Upwork may be a bit tough or competitive at first. Keep at it and you’ll definitely grow.“
