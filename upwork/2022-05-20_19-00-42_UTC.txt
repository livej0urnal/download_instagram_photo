Meet Alexandra Bermont, Top Rated social media marketing specialist and community manager. #UpworkSpotlight

“I found Upwork on Google. I wanted to be free! [I have been] seriously freelancing only since December 2020 and I am about to be a Top Rated Plus freelancer soon!” 

Why does she believe freelancers are a great choice for business? “Independence for sure! They are creative, adaptable, and smart. That’s how I would define most freelancers. They can give a different point of view and are definitely a great choice for when a specific expertise is needed.”

"My favorite thing about working with clients I find on Upwork is that I can get the chance to work and collaborate with people from all over the globe. Since I speak a few languages, it allows me to work with different nationalities! I love the fact that I can choose who I work with, the niche of my client, and all the opportunities in terms of networking that it brings me. The independence I have from working this way makes me very happy too."

"I ensure my clients have an amazing experience with me by providing soft skills such as professionalism, flexibility, creativity, details-orientation, and the ability to meet deadlines. Because I am an expert in my field too, which is social media marketing, I have the confidence to help my clients to shine in their business and to create a sustainable strategy for them. My wish is always to bring my best to clients so we can build solid and long term partnerships together."
