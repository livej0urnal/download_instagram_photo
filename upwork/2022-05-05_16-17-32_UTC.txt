Meet Manisha Naimish Anarkat, our first spotlight for #APAHMHeritageMonth! Manisha is a Senior Director of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Compliance and Internal Audit. She takes great pride in being Asian-American and cites the “glorious Indian culture” for her deep respect for people of different cultural backgrounds. “The Indian culture made me a strong believer in Karma and influenced me to make an impact and give back to the community.”

She’s inspired by many Asian-American icons but especially Kamala Harris, Vice President of the US, as a point of pride. As for how she celebrates AAPI Heritage Month, she says, “I have planned to celebrate AAPI Heritage month with the Asian-American community at various cultural events. I also enjoy dining at local Asian restaurants.”

“Every day at work, I take pride in having the freedom to be authentic myself and be an effective leader. Namaste!”

We appreciate having you on our team Manisha!
