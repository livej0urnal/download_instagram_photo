#MotherhoodWorks = a special set of super transferrable skills that only come from hands-on experience. ü§ù

#Repost @sophia__renee: In the last couple of years, I have juggled working from home while taking care of my two young kids. Being a mother means you have to lead and encourage a team everyday, you have to solve problems, adapt, manage your time, multi-task like a pro, organize chaos, juggle responsibilities, and show up everyday better than you did the day before. It requires a special set of skills that only comes from hands-on experience. 
 
The skills I have gained since becoming a mom relate directly to my professional life. My transferable skills are a perk of motherhood I never expected. As a mom, I have mastered the art of leading, advocating, prioritizing, listening, communicating, implementing, planning, scheduling and multi-tasking to name a few. Mothers have every skill needed to excel in the workforce, yet workforce participation for women is at its lowest in 30 years as millions of moms have had to deal with biases and inflexible work structures that were magnified in the last couple of years.
