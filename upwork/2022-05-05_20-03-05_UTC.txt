Our second spotlight for Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi American Heritage Month (APIDA) is  @myotherofficeph. Czar de Los Reyes is from the Philippines 🇵🇭 and our Hybrid Workforce Recruiting Manager. "I celebrate being Asian/ Filipino every day! Being proud of who I am and embracing my roots makes the [APA] Heritage Month all the more meaningful!”

For Czar, the APIDA community members who inspire her are some of her colleagues who are also women in tech.👩‍💻“I want to be like them!”

💚“I love how Upwork has a culturally diverse team and working here for almost 9 years, I've seen how strong the Upwork values are through my colleagues. Witnessing this makes me feel comfortable bringing my authentic self to work.”

Thanks for being part of the team Czar, we appreciate you!
