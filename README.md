Hi this is my python script repository that allows you to download posts from an instagram user profile.
Requires the instaload library. Therefore, before starting, you must install this library using the PiP package manager
-pip install instaloader
The script itself is optimized for a normal user and can be run both from the console and the editor, if available.
Python.
I will be grateful if you leave a response!
